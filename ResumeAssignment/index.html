          Hello! my name  is Kennedy Amucha and I am an aspiring web designer. As a creative, I have spun my passion for bringing people joy through art, into a newfound love for web and mobile design.

        </p>
        <p>
          I discovered this passion on a whim as I was searching through career choices to pursue and through my research I found that web design encompasses almost everything I love to do.
          
          I am an artist at heart, but I also love challenges and am a natural problem solver. I love working with people and I discovered that through designing I can flex both my creativity and my mind by developing appealing, accessible, and user-friendly websites for the community.
